## Handling Click Events in JavaScript
When working with click events in JavaScript, it's crucial to understand how the onclick method functions and the limitations associated with direct execution.

## Direct Execution Limitation
Attempting to execute a function directly by placing parentheses after its name in the onclick attribute won't work as expected. For instance, `onclick={setColor('red')}` will execute the function immediately, which is not the desired behavior.

## Using Callback Function
To address the limitation, it's essential to provide a reference to the function without executing it directly. Utilizing a callback function is a common approach. For example, `onclick={() => setColor('red')}` ensures that the function is called when the click event occurs.

## Passing Arguments
When passing arguments to a function in the onclick attribute, it's advisable to use an arrow function. This allows for the inclusion of parameters without immediate execution. For instance, `onclick={() => myFunction(arg)}` ensures proper handling of arguments.

Ensure a clear understanding of these concepts to effectively handle click events and maintain the desired functionality in your JavaScript code. 

Happy coding!
